# Project Rules

- Maintain the current structure — don’t create new folders unless justified.
- Prioritize small, reviewable commits with minimal diffs.
- Use Python virtual environments and typed functions where appropriate.
- Avoid committing any secrets (e.g., .env files, API keys, credentials).
- For AI code review, prefer using Cursor with Codex or GPT-4 when possible.
- AI code suggestions should follow existing architectural patterns and avoid speculative rewrites.
